# db-gpt
This project is a sophisticated AI-powered SQL generator and executor. By leveraging OpenAI's GPT model, it allows users to input a database request in natural language and translates it into a PostgreSQL query. The user enters their request via a simple form and the system seamlessly connects to the database, introspects the schema, and generates the corresponding SQL code.

This application democratizes the power of SQL by encapsulating the complexity of query generation. It's a useful tool for those who need to interact with databases but may not have extensive SQL knowledge or for those who simply want to speed up the process of creating and running SQL queries.
